# Behavior_graph_analytics_engine
A full analytics engine that can chew on user behavior events, model patterns, and visualize journeys through an app.

Inspired by a behavior analytics system that I sneak-peeked while seeking inspiration from nature's very best creations.

For development purposes, it currently just feeds logs from a mock mobile app or website which I generate the  yourself (for now), and it builds:

• A flow graph showing how users move through screens
• A dropout prediction module that flags where users give up
• A node importance calculator using graph theory
• A real-time dashboard showing performance, anomalies, and engagement trends
